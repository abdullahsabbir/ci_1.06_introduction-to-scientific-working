##### Hypothesis:

Despite of the existence of a numerous implementations of embedded system coding, designing a digital voltmeter (DVM) is still considered as an innovative implementation. A voltmeter is an instrument used for measuring the electrical potential difference between two points in an electric circuit. At first analog voltmeters were very popular among the people for taking the reading of the voltage. On later period, digital voltmeters were introduced and became popular. Analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale in proportion to the voltage of the circuit; digital voltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by use of an analog to digital converter. Digital voltmeters (DVM) are usually designed around a special type of analog-to-digital converter called an integrating converter. Voltmeter accuracy is affected by many factors, including temperature and supply voltage variations. To ensure that a digital voltmeter's reading is within the manufacturer's specified tolerances, they should be periodically calibrated against a voltage standard. These types of voltmeters are very cheap and also very flexible to the users.

##### Experimets:

This paper will describe how to make a simple digital voltmeter using a PIC16F877A microcontroller. The range of this DVM is 0-220V, but the range can be easily increased or decreased based on the requirements just using the calibration process described in this project.

###### Components used

- Transformer (12*2)
- PIC16F877A
- Capacitor (1 uf)
- Diodes
- Resistors (10K)
- Variable resistor
- AC cord
- Connecting wires

###### Calibration

Calibration is a comparison between measurements – one of known magnitude or correctness made or set with one device and another measurement made in as similar a way as possible with a second device. Calibration means to calibrate or adjust between two different values of voltage to get the desired output. 

Here the transformer transforms the 220 V to 12 V first as it is a 12*2 transformer. Two diodes are used to make the AC voltage to DC by rectifying it through full-wave rectification. Then to stabilize the voltage a capacitor is used. To grab the voltage a resistor is put just in parallel to the capacitor. Therefore 12 V will be shown across the resistor. Again two resistors (series) are connected just parallel to the previous resistor. Between these two, one was variable resistor. It should be varied with respect to the display part. While adjusting it with 220 V the experiment is then stopped. This is called the calibration. It has to be done as because the Microchip can operate within the analog signal from 0-5 V. So it can be said that the maximum input voltage of 220V is calibrated as 5V to the chip. 

###### Full-Wave Rectification

Full wave rectification is done by the two diodes. The output is got both for positive and negative half cycle of the input voltage.

###### Software Portion

Code is written in the MPLAB software. The code is mainly based on the concept of binary to BCD conversion. The delay used in this code is 0.125 sec. Left justification is done to get the higher bits in ADRESH resistor. Therefore the value of ADRESH is sent to PORT-B in order to display the value. Channel 2 of the microcontroller is used here. So the input will be given at PIN-4 of the microcontroller. Mainly the PORT-A was used as the analog input port and PORT-B as output. That’s why binary value of ‘11111111’ is sent to TRISA to make all the pins of PORT-A as input pins. Vice-versa was done for PORT-B. That’s how the process is done. The code is then compiled using a compiler which converts the language to assembly language to make it readable for the microcontroller. 

##### Conclusion

This project successfully executed a relatively cheaper voltmeter, comparing to those present in the market. This research will enhance the possibility of using digital voltmeters to improve small industries in Bangladesh.
