##### Hypothesis:

Contemporary Next Generation Networks (NGN) are mainly built on the Internet Protocol (IP) and Ethernet. Major challenge for emerging types of wired and wireless IP-based networks is to provide an adequate Quality of Service (QoS) for different services. The quality of evaluation requires a detailed knowledge of the performance requirements for particular services and applications. 

##### Experimets:

The Next Generation Networks are built mainly on the Internet Protocol (IP) stack and the Ethernet. The simulator of the Ethernet and the IP network can be used for testing of new network elements and services. The Ethernet network emulator “EtherShaper” was developed on the Telecommunication Technology Department of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the Czech Technical University in Prague.

The feature and capability of the EtherShaper includes the following items:
- two RJ-45 ports for Ethernet testing (port A and port B)
- supported Ethernet versions: 10Base-T, 100Base-Tx
- duplex mode: Half, Full, auto-negotiation
- speed: 10 Mbit/s, 100 Mbit/s, auto-negotiation
- minimal Ethernet frame size: 50 bytes
- maximal Ethernet frame size: 1500 bytes
- independent adjustable true linear delay in both directions in range from 0,5 ms to 30 s
- independent adjustable “RAMP” delay in both directions. RAMP is defined with start delay, end delay and incremented in s per ms
- independent adjustable loss in both directions in range from 0 % to 100 %
- load/Save user configuration

The low cost Ethernet network emulator is based on the PC platform with double LAN card and OS Linux. The Ethershaper Unit uses a  standard GNU/Linux operating system. There is the only one requirement and that the kernel version which must be at least 2.6.21 (because of using a High-Res timer).

The EtherShaper can be connected between the Ethernet Generator and Analyzer anywhere in a broadcast domain.
In this case, the generated Ethernet traffic is modified in the EtherShaper and sent to the Analyzer. The Ethernet
traffic can be modified only in one direction (see Fig. 5). Both - the EtherShaper Unit and the measuring equipment must be placed in the same broadcast domain.

The Ethernet network emulator EtherShaper Unit can be connected between the Ethernet Generator/Analyzer and the loopback units placed anywhere in a broadcast domain. In this case, the generated Ethernet traffic is modified in the EtherShaper and sent afterwards to the loopback device. The Loopback device loops the traffic back to the analyzer through the EtherShaper (see Fig. 4). The Ethernet traffic can be modified in the both directions. The EtherShaper and the measuring equipment must be placed in the same broadcast domain.

The Ethernet network emulator EtherShaper Unit can be utilized in the networks that are compatible with the Ethernet standard [1]. Placing the EtherShaper Unit into the same broadcast domain (as the devices whose traffic is shaped) is necessary condition for a good function.


##### Conclusion

The paper represented the integration of the EtherShaper Unit within a common wired and wireless networks based on the Ethernet. The EtherShaper was used in laboratory network on Department of Telecommunication Engineering for education and for testing of new networks nodes and services. The adding software modules for other types of variable delay will be developed during this year. The extension for emulation network with E1 interfaces and TDM over IP transmission uses external standard serial produced converters which change E1 to Ethernet. The program must calculate the adding process delay for TDM to the packet conversion.
