##### Hypothesis:

Since the 20th century, high-power light-emitting diode (LED) is keeping attracting interests due to its significant impacts on solid-state illumination industry and it is a strong candidate for the next generation of general illumination applications. However, at present, the thermal fluxes of LED chips are more than 100 W/cm2, the junction temperature of LED should be controlled below 110°C, and thermal problem caused by the heat generated within the LED itself is still a bottleneck to limit the stability, reliability, and lifetime of high-power LED. The hot-spot effect and high spreading resistance result in the higher junction temperature. Therefore, effective thermal design of LED packages with low thermal resistance is critical to improve the performance of LED.

In order to enhance the thermal performance of the device, currently, cooling technical development related to the application of two-phase flow heat transfer assembly to thermal modules has become mature and heat pipe–based thermal module is one of the best choices.

Phase-change cooling is a promising method for cooling high heat flux devices. Vapor chamber is one kind of phase-change heat transfer devices using phase-change cooling method. It has already been confirmed that the vapor chamber has antigravity, high effective thermal conductivity, and is suitable for high heat flux of a heat source as the integrated heat spreader.

However, there is lack of study for the thermal resistance effects with respect to the high-power (more than 50 W) LED array compared with common copper-based plate in natural convection cooling at ambient temperature.

In this article, a compact high-power LED array with vapor chamber–based plate has been designed and fabricated. The device surface temperature distribution of a 100-W power input LED array using a vapor chamber–based plate has been investigated using a thermal infrared (IR) camera and the MicReD T3Ster analyzer. To make a comparison, the LED array using a copper-based plate was also investigated.

##### Experimets:

###### Equipments and preparation

In this study, a vapor chamber, supplied by Nanjing ACME Co. Ltd (China), made of aluminum alloy pasting LED chips array measures the thermal performance with a heat pipe radiator. The vapor chamber is constructed of two flat plates with 0.2 mm thickness and a frame. Its dimensions are 60 × 60 × 3.0 mm3, the interior wick structure of vapor chamber is wire mesh, and in the evaporating side are the two layers of 180-pore wire meshes of sintered metal powders and in the condensing side is one layer of 100-pore wire meshes. The wire meshes are bonded to the condensing and evaporating sides and around the internal surface to ensure the circulation of the water working fluid to form big water circulation. Several 1.8-mm-diameter porous medium aluminum cylinders supported vacuum and loading force.

The commercial GaN-based LEDs coated with blue color (Epistar Venus-series) were used for the fabrication of an array in this experiment. The LED chips were mounted as 10 × 11 arrays by an automatic die bonder (ASM AD860) using silver epoxy die attach adhesive (DDA) on the vapor chamber–based plate. The mounted LED array area is about 24 × 24 mm2. The DDA is the silver filled epoxy of Tanaka model TS-369-E31. The thermal conductivity of the DDA is about 96 W/m K from the manufacturer’s specification. The silver epoxy DDA acts as a prominent thermal interface material (TIM) to reduce the thermal contact resistance (TCR) between the LED chip and the substrate. In order to measure the interface temperature of the LED chips, no encapsulation process was performed on the LED chip so that the chip can be exposed for IR imaging inspection and only packed with a F4R to link wire. To make a comparison, a typical commercial chip on board (COB)-type LED array using a copper-based plate which has the same chips layout was also fabricated. The material of copper-based plate was also made from the same 99.9% oxygen-free copper. All the LED chips were placed on the copper-based plate with the same process of the previous vapor chamber–based plate.

An optimized heat pipe radiator suitable for high-power electronic devices has been assembled to quickly dissipate the heat which is generated from the LED array. The dimensions of the heat pipe radiator were L × W × H = 274 × 180 × 94 mm3. The thermal resistance of the heat pipe radiator was 0.19 K/W at 100 W power input with the cooling of natural convection at room temperature 25°C. a TIM (Silanex model ST0903) has been installed between the base plates and the heat pipe radiators to reduce the TCR. A 500 meshes of steel wire mesh (about 24 µm in hole-diameter) is used to coat the TIM onto the contact surfaces to ensure the uniform bond line thickness. The same force between the two kinds of base plate and the heat pipe radiator has been exerted by the torque wrench with several tightened bolts. The thermal conductivity of the TIM is about 30 W/m K from the manufacturer’s specification.

Thermal surface measurements of the two kinds of base plate LED arrays have been achieved with a Fluke Ti32 uncooled thermal IR camera. All the tests are conducted in a JEDEC standard test chamber which is the normal environment with the same heat pipe radiator cooling by natural convection at ambient temperature of 25 ± 3°C. The thermal path (junction-to-case) is determined by the transient thermal analysis using the MicReD T3Ster analyzer.12 The power input was exerted by a direct current (DC) power supply (Agilent 6675A). The operating voltage is fixed at a constant level of 33.3 V, and the input current is 3 A.

###### Experimental uncertainty

An uncertainty analysis is conducted to determine the maximum error for the heat transfer performance of the high-power LED array thermal module. The uncertainty of surface temperature measurements for Fluke Ti32 uncooled thermal IR camera was reported by the producer as ±2°C. All thermocouples used in this experiment are T-type with an experimental uncertainty of ±0.5°C. The uncertainty of input power Q is less than ±0.5 W.

###### Experimental procedure

The experimental test was performed to investigate the thermal performance of the high-power LED array thermal module. A series of tests are carried out for the following conditions:

For thermal test, the rate of heat transfer to the LED array is calculated from the following relation: 𝑄=𝑈2/𝑅, where 𝑈 is the input voltage and 𝑅 is the electrical resistance of the LED array.

After the high-power LED array thermal module has been placed in the JEDEC standard test chamber, turn on the power supply to offer LED power input. One can record the measuring data when the entire test system is kept on for about 3 h and reaches a steady state.

##### Conclusion

In this study, a compact 100-W high-power LED vapor chamber–based plate has been designed and fabricated. The temperature distributions are investigated and compared with a compact 100-W high-power LED array copper-based plate using a thermal IR camera and a MicReD T3Ster analyzer. The experimental results show that the thermal performance of the compact LED array vapor chamber–based plate is much better than that of the LED array copper-based plate with the same heat pipe radiator in natural convection. And the average temperatures of LED copper- and vapor chamber–based plate are 100.5°C and 41.5°C at 100 W, respectively. In addition, 100 W LED array vapor chamber–based plate is 2.2°C less than 31.7°C of the 100-W LED array copper-based plate for the central wall temperature of the lighting side. Thus, the vapor chamber provides a recommendable thermal management approach to solve the heat dissipation of the compact high-power LED array at not less or equal to 100 W electric power input. Furthermore, the measurement results show that the vapor chamber can effectively lower the thermal spreading resistance and work out the hot-spot problem. Thus, the vapor chamber provides an excellent thermal management base plate material to solve the heat transfer of the compact high-power LED array.

##### Hypothesis:

Contemporary Next Generation Networks (NGN) are mainly built on the Internet Protocol (IP) and Ethernet. Major challenge for emerging types of wired and wireless IP-based networks is to provide an adequate Quality of Service (QoS) for different services. The quality of evaluation requires a detailed knowledge of the performance requirements for particular services and applications. 

##### Experimets:

The Next Generation Networks are built mainly on the Internet Protocol (IP) stack and the Ethernet. The simulator of the Ethernet and the IP network can be used for testing of new network elements and services. The Ethernet network emulator “EtherShaper” was developed on the Telecommunication Technology Department of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the Czech Technical University in Prague.

The feature and capability of the EtherShaper includes the following items:
- two RJ-45 ports for Ethernet testing (port A and port B)
- supported Ethernet versions: 10Base-T, 100Base-Tx
- duplex mode: Half, Full, auto-negotiation
- speed: 10 Mbit/s, 100 Mbit/s, auto-negotiation
- minimal Ethernet frame size: 50 bytes
- maximal Ethernet frame size: 1500 bytes
- independent adjustable true linear delay in both directions in range from 0,5 ms to 30 s
- independent adjustable “RAMP” delay in both directions. RAMP is defined with start delay, end delay and incremented in s per ms
- independent adjustable loss in both directions in range from 0 % to 100 %
- load/Save user configuration

The low cost Ethernet network emulator is based on the PC platform with double LAN card and OS Linux. The Ethershaper Unit uses a  standard GNU/Linux operating system. There is the only one requirement and that the kernel version which must be at least 2.6.21 (because of using a High-Res timer).

The EtherShaper can be connected between the Ethernet Generator and Analyzer anywhere in a broadcast domain.
In this case, the generated Ethernet traffic is modified in the EtherShaper and sent to the Analyzer. The Ethernet
traffic can be modified only in one direction (see Fig. 5). Both - the EtherShaper Unit and the measuring equipment must be placed in the same broadcast domain.

The Ethernet network emulator EtherShaper Unit can be connected between the Ethernet Generator/Analyzer and the loopback units placed anywhere in a broadcast domain. In this case, the generated Ethernet traffic is modified in the EtherShaper and sent afterwards to the loopback device. The Loopback device loops the traffic back to the analyzer through the EtherShaper (see Fig. 4). The Ethernet traffic can be modified in the both directions. The EtherShaper and the measuring equipment must be placed in the same broadcast domain.

The Ethernet network emulator EtherShaper Unit can be utilized in the networks that are compatible with the Ethernet standard [1]. Placing the EtherShaper Unit into the same broadcast domain (as the devices whose traffic is shaped) is necessary condition for a good function.

##### Conclusion

The paper represented the integration of the EtherShaper Unit within a common wired and wireless networks based on the Ethernet. The EtherShaper was used in laboratory network on Department of Telecommunication Engineering for education and for testing of new networks nodes and services. The adding software modules for other types of variable delay will be developed during this year. The extension for emulation network with E1 interfaces and TDM over IP transmission uses external standard serial produced converters which change E1 to Ethernet. The program must calculate the adding process delay for TDM to the packet conversion.

### Paper Title: Construction of Microcontroller Based Digital Voltmeter

#### Answers:

##### Hypothesis:

Despite of the existence of a numerous implementations of embedded system coding, designing a digital voltmeter (DVM) is still considered as an innovative implementation. A voltmeter is an instrument used for measuring the electrical potential difference between two points in an electric circuit. At first analog voltmeters were very popular among the people for taking the reading of the voltage. On later period, digital voltmeters were introduced and became popular. Analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale in proportion to the voltage of the circuit; digital voltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by use of an analog to digital converter. Digital voltmeters (DVM) are usually designed around a special type of analog-to-digital converter called an integrating converter. Voltmeter accuracy is affected by many factors, including temperature and supply voltage variations. To ensure that a digital voltmeter's reading is within the manufacturer's specified tolerances, they should be periodically calibrated against a voltage standard. These types of voltmeters are very cheap and also very flexible to the users.

##### Experimets:

This paper will describe how to make a simple digital voltmeter using a PIC16F877A microcontroller. The range of this DVM is 0-220V, but the range can be easily increased or decreased based on the requirements just using the calibration process described in this project.

###### Components used

- Transformer (12*2)
- PIC16F877A
- Capacitor (1 uf)
- Diodes
- Resistors (10K)
- Variable resistor
- AC cord
- Connecting wires

###### Calibration

Calibration is a comparison between measurements – one of known magnitude or correctness made or set with one device and another measurement made in as similar a way as possible with a second device. Calibration means to calibrate or adjust between two different values of voltage to get the desired output. 

Here the transformer transforms the 220 V to 12 V first as it is a 12*2 transformer. Two diodes are used to make the AC voltage to DC by rectifying it through full-wave rectification. Then to stabilize the voltage a capacitor is used. To grab the voltage a resistor is put just in parallel to the capacitor. Therefore 12 V will be shown across the resistor. Again two resistors (series) are connected just parallel to the previous resistor. Between these two, one was variable resistor. It should be varied with respect to the display part. While adjusting it with 220 V the experiment is then stopped. This is called the calibration. It has to be done as because the Microchip can operate within the analog signal from 0-5 V. So it can be said that the maximum input voltage of 220V is calibrated as 5V to the chip. 

###### Full-Wave Rectification

Full wave rectification is done by the two diodes. The output is got both for positive and negative half cycle of the input voltage.

###### Software Portion

Code is written in the MPLAB software. The code is mainly based on the concept of binary to BCD conversion. The delay used in this code is 0.125 sec. Left justification is done to get the higher bits in ADRESH resistor. Therefore the value of ADRESH is sent to PORT-B in order to display the value. Channel 2 of the microcontroller is used here. So the input will be given at PIN-4 of the microcontroller. Mainly the PORT-A was used as the analog input port and PORT-B as output. That’s why binary value of ‘11111111’ is sent to TRISA to make all the pins of PORT-A as input pins. Vice-versa was done for PORT-B. That’s how the process is done. The code is then compiled using a compiler which converts the language to assembly language to make it readable for the microcontroller. 

##### Conclusion

This project successfully executed a relatively cheaper voltmeter, comparing to those present in the market. This research will enhance the possibility of using digital voltmeters to improve small industries in Bangladesh.
